[Items][Modding]
(rev 0.1)
An item is a bunch of files which identify it in the game and scripts what it does.
To add your own item in this game, go to "[game root]/elements/items/" then :
- Add "YourItemId.json", "YourItemId.data.json" and "YourItemId.use.js" (and you can also add "YourItemId.ico.png" as icon (size 64*64))
- Edit "itemslist.json", add a new line and add an entry with your ItemID in the json array. It should look like : 
[
	"FirstItem",
	"SecondItem",
	"AnotherItem",
	"YourItemId"
]

Then, in "YourItemId.json", you'll have to set your item's parameters like this (double slashes are comments, so I'm sure you'll understand :3):
{
	"itemid": "YourItemId", // You never write it enough
	"itemname": "My item", // Your item's name
	"online": 0, // 1 if the item is usable online, 0 if not. It's used because when you play online, items are edited by the server
	"onuseScript": "YourItemId.use.js",  // The path for the script
	"icon": "ItemIcon.ico.png", // Icon Paths
	"Type": "Weapon" // Your item's type*(see note 1)
	"data": "YourItemId.data.json" // Contains your own data for your item, like durability, etc...
}

In "YourItemId.data.json", put every data you want to access in your item's script (it's JSON, so it's pretty easy to make something well).

In "YourItemId.use.js", there is your script when you use your item. Because it's rev 0.1, it's very basic. Write what you want in javascript.
